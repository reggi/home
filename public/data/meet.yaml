bio: |
  Hi, I'm Thomas Reggi (he/they) 👋. I most likley gave you a business card, met you at a DND night, or met online somewhere.

  I am actively seeking to find a community, meet new people, make friends, learn, and grow in 2023.
  
  I'm making more of an effort to participate in potlucks 🍲, meet people in person 🤝, grab coffee ☕️, attend events and meetups 📆, and meet people on apps like Bumble 🐝.
